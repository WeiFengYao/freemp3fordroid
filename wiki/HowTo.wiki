Instructions. Use the following code:

{{{
Intent intent = new Intent("org.freemp3droid.CONVERT");
intent.putExtra("convertFile", "rawFile.pcm");
intent.putExtra("progressFile","prog.txt");
intent.putExtra("mp3File", "convertToThisFile.mp3");	
intent.putExtra("stopFile", "stop.txt");
intent.putExtra("sampleRate",44100);
intent.putExtra("bitRate",192);

Main.this.startActivity(intent);
}}}


Explanation of files:

convertFile: the raw pcm or wav data to convert to MP3

progressFile: a file that the library updates constantly to report how many bytes have been 
processed. When this value equals that of the convertFile.length then conversion is complete

mp3File: the desired file to write the mp3 to

stopFile:if you want to prematurely cancel conversion, then write "1" to this file.

Enjoy !
